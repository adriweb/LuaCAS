Simplification / Factor algorithm
Adriweb 2012


Let's consider the input : 

    3*x+x

1) Transform all occurrences of "-x" and "+x" by : "-1*x" or "+1*x"

2) RPN all that. We have : 3,x,*,1,x,*,+

3) Make groups (like trees actually).

4) 	Get the Global (outer) operator. here : "+"	
	Get the inside operator(s). Here, "*" and "*"
	Get the coefficients for the inner parts. Here, Coeff1 = "3" and Coeff2 =  "1"
	Get the variable for the coeff (if same variable for each coeff)

5)	Check if the inside operators are the same. Here "*". They are the same.

6)	If so -> Apply that Formula :    [ ( ] [Coeff1] [GlobalOperator] [Coeff2] [ ) ] [InsideOp] [Variable]
		Here that would be :       ( 3 + 1 ) * x

7)	Recombine everything

8)	Simplify what we can by calculating numerical stuff.

9)	Enjoy
